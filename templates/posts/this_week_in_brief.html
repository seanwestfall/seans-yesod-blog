<p>Still working on my portfolio in middleman… JS timeout functions and the css transition property can be very tricky — and also messy. I wish there was a cleaner way to write a very animated website.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’ve been working with some friends on an android picture app and I’ve been tasked with building the web server. I’m building the authentication with strongloop loop back, a nodejs framework. Their API docs are down for some reason and it’s totally killing my productivity. Right now I’m specifically having trouble with the android adapter. Their implementation makes use of Java generics, and for the most part I think it makes everything a whole lot more confusing. Generics can lead to over abstraction — just doing the simple and obvious would save a lot of time and headaches…</p>
<p>Big news at work: My current PM put in his two weeks last week friday — or actually today. This will make things a whole lot different there at Model Mayhem, considering the PM is in control of just about everything. I care barely imagine what it’s going to be like having to take directions from somebody else. I only hope that this doesn’t adversely affect the recent up turn in user subscriptions and page views Model Mayhem has been experiencing lately with the new homepage. We shall see.</p>
