<p>Haven’t been writing much lately. I guess it because I’ve had many other things on my mind.</p>
<p>All I can think about right now is how awful the taste of the tea I’m drinking right now is. (Celestial Seasonings – Green Tea)</p>
<p>So today, I went to the LACMA. For the second time in a row, for a weekend.</p>
<p>A few thought about it,</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s nice working next to the LACMA because it inspires you so much at work. I feel like I should out to go out and do something worthy of historical remembrance. I’m truly fortunate that I have a job that allows me in such close proximity to priceless icons of Western (and non-western) civilization.</li>
<li>World War I/II still reflects so heavily on our culture. The pieces from the Weimer republic, 1920s/1930s are probably the most impressive pieces there. It’s interesting to think about how the event influenced popular taste thereafter – abstract expressionism and post-modernist art wouldn’t have its influence today, if the world wars didn’t bear so much after thought and social conscious introspection.</li>
</ol>
<p>So where does this leave me… After seeing the paintings from the era of the Weimer republic, it makes me wonder about what technology is doing to society today, and if it’s at all causing the same sort of alienations and absurdist conditions that the Germans experienced during the 1920-30s. Looking at myself, and how I feel about life and what I’m dealing with momentarily, I wonder if it’s at all unnatural and inhuman.</p>
<p>Today we live in a world where everything can occur and be responded to in real time. Social networks and the internet allow human beings to respond to events near instantaneously. There are no geographical limitations to communication – you can see and respond to a message that’s only limited theoretically by the speed of light (light can circumvent the Earth 7 times in a single second). Our own brain cells respond to information slower than it takes for it to appear in front of our eyes.</p>
<p>Not to say this is anything new – technological advancement has always moved in the direction of increasing the speed of thoughts /and emotions, reducing physical barriers, and the capacity to which messages can be spread to receivers. This can be observed from the invention of writing, to the printing press, to radio/television, and to the internet of today. And it is near certain that this will only continue on into the future – technology will only find newer ways to move thoughts faster, and to spread them farther.</p>
<p>Technology is both empowering and bewildering. The common man has been empowered to create and impact the masses. But it’s this permanent connection to the masses that I personally find so heavy.</p>
<p>Considering it’s possible for people to converse in immediacy – now that we’re no longer bounded by time and/or physical space – where does that leave us as human beings and our capacity to truly connect and understand each other. There’s been so many moments lately where I feel inept, and I don’t know what to say – it leaves me wondering what that means and whose business is to defined what’s socially right and wrong. I’ve tried my best to see things from other sides (and not strictly from my own), because that seems right. I find myself today spending all my time thinking about what the are the right words to say – which leaves me often not saying anything at all.</p>
<p>I imagine if people can say one thing about me, it probably be that I’m really quiet – but it’s because I was raised to only speak when I know what I’m talking about. I think because this trait was instilled into me, I’ve spent much of my younger life thinking about what certainty is. My current conclusions on the subject is that there is no such thing as certainty, and as Nietzsche puts it, “insanity is the delusion of certainty”. (In college, and even after, I’ve found that these sort of thoughts are typically what led one to be reprimanded – because they’re impractical, and they often lead a person to ignore real-world problems – which is true)</p>
<p>With everybody that you know, and whom you’ll eventually know, in such close proximity and within immediate connection – what’s the right way to act? How do you know you’re not acting immature or foolish.</p>
<p>I don’t really have a conclusion for any of these thoughts, I’m still working through them. In connection to how I started this piece, maybe the conclusion is the same that 20th century artist took after the war, that good/bad art/life/craft can be anything, and that the very presence of something is enough to define it as art (and to have significance) – and to define it so strictly otherwise can only lead to destruction – but with the whole world connected, and with your actions having so many unforeseen consequences and repercussions, is it fair to say you can act like anything?</p>
<p>(Also these are only the conclusions of the Western world – there still large parts of the world that believe otherwise – and have been for a long while – i.e. Muslims/Arabs/Hindus)</p>
