<h5><a id="Chartless_0"></a>Chartless</h5>
<p>I never saw a moor,<br>
I never saw the sea;<br>
Yet now I know how the heather looks,<br>
And what a wave must be</p>
<p>I never spoke with God,<br>
Nor visited in Heaven;<br>
Yet certain am I of the spot<br>
As if the chart were given.</p>
<p>â€“ Emily Dickinson</p>
