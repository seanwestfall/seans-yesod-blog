<h4><a id="Nick_Drake__Place_to_be_0"></a>Nick Drake – Place to be</h4>
<p>When I was younger, younger than before,<br>
I never saw the truth hanging from the door<br>
And now I’m older see it face to face<br>
And now I’m older gotta get up clean the place.</p>
<p>And I was green, greener than the hill<br>
Where the flowers grew and the sun shone still<br>
Now I’m darker than the deepest sea<br>
Just hand me down, give me a place to be.</p>
<p>And I was strong, strong in the sun<br>
I thought I’d see when day is done<br>
Now I’m weaker than the palest blue<br>
Oh, so weak in this need for you.</p>
