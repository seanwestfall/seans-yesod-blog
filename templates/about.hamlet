<h1> About
<p> This is the personal blog of Sean Westfall, I write mostly about programming — but I’m interested in other things aswell. The languages I’m most interested in are Haskell, C, and C++. Drop me a line below if you want to talk about anything.
<h2> The Symbolism of Goldfish
<p> The goldfish brings good luck in the form of tranquility, wisdom and long life. It is one among the eight sacred symbols of the Buddha where they represent fertility, abundance and harmony with the flow of life. Ancient Greeks believed goldfish enhanced good luck in marriage and relationships. In ancient Egypt goldfish were kept in the house as a lucky omen for the family and helped cheer up domestic situations.
<h2> About Me
<p> My name is Sean. I currently live in Long Beach, California — a neighborhood in Los Angeles County in Southern California. Though, I’ve lived in Chicago, Honolulu, and Maui, Hawaii (my birth place). I’m currently working as a web developer on ModelMayhem: A social networking site for photographers and models. This blog is predominately about programming, though I may discuss other things if I feel inclined.
